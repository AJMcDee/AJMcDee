I am a super passionate, high-energy, and ambitious developer who is open about her mistakes and is keen to learn from them. Spot something you think could be better? Great! Please let me know:


I've been making webpages since I was 8 years old, but I took a huge detour in the middle and so am more often recognised as being "that dev who used to be an opera singer".


- 🌱 I’m learning full-stack web development with the Digital Careers Institute in Leipzig, Germany until June 2021.
- 💪 My course is one year full-time and is German government accredited
- 💻 My stack is HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
