I am a super passionate, high-energy, and ambitious developer who is open about her mistakes and is keen to learn from them. Spot something you think could be better? Great! Please get in touch.

I've been making webpages since I was 8 years old, but I took a huge detour in the middle and so am more often recognised as being "that dev who used to be an opera singer".
